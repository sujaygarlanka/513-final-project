# 513-final-project

## Coding Steps

1. Have a robot navigate to multiple locations in an empty scene with 2D simulator and VR
2. Be able to place objects and automated moving humans.
3. Implement DWA

Extension:
1. Have robot pick up object at each location using an arm and put it in a basket.
2. This is a stretch, but use LIDAR to detect humans and objects
